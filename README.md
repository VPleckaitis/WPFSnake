# WPFSnake

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/VPleckaitis/WPFSnake.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/VPleckaitis/WPFSnake)

Just snake game in WPF - tried to recreate childhood game from scratch.

Difference from original snake - after eating food snake leaves digested food in the same location, which is pretty much indestructable wall.

Updates will be very irregular.
